### Azure account

You need an Azure account to complete the tutorial. You can:

* [Open an Azure account for free](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). You get credits that can be used to try out paid Azure services. Even after the credits are used up, you can keep the account and use free Azure services and features, such as the Web Apps feature in Azure App Service.
* [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.

If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter  app in App Service â€” no credit card required, and no commitments.

### <a name="setupdevenv"></a>Visual Studio 2015 with the Azure SDK for .NET

The tutorial is written for Visual Studio 2015 with the Azure SDK for .NET 2.8.2 or later. If you have an earlier version, or if you don't have Visual Studio 2015, [download the latest Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518003). Visual Studio 2015 is automatically installed with the SDK if you don't already have it.

If you have Visual Studio 2013, and you want to use that, [download the latest Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=324322). The instructions are basically the same but some screens may look different.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Depending on how many of the SDK dependencies you already have on your machine, installing the SDK could take a long time, from several minutes to a half hour or more.

### ASP.NET Web API

The tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to work with ASP.NET [Web API 2](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api) in Visual Studio.
