### Obtain the Storage Client Library package

You can use NuGet to obtain Storage Client Library package and its dependencies. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.  Search online for "WindowsAzure.Storage" and click **Install** to install the Azure Storage package and dependencies.

The Storage Client Library package is also included in the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/). However, we recommend that you install the Storage Client Library from NuGet to ensure that you always have the latest version of the client library.
