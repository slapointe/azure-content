# Convert existing databases to use elastic database tools

If you have an existing scaled-out, sharded solution, you can take advantage of the Elastic database tools, like [Elastic Database client library](sql-database-elastic-database-client-library.md) and the [split-merge tool](sql-database-elastic-scale-overview-split-and-merge.md), by using the techniques described here. 

These techniques can be implemented using either the [.NET Framework client library](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale.Client/), or the PowerShell scripts found at [Azure SQL DB - Elastic Database tools scripts](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Azure-SQL-DB-Elastic-731883db). The examples here use the PowerShell scripts.

Note that you must create the databases before executing the Add-Shard and New-ShardMapManager cmdlets. The cmdlets do not create databases for you.

There are four steps:

1. Prepare the shard map manager database.
2. Create the shard map.
3. Prepare the individual shards.  
2. Add the mappings to the shard map.

For more information about the ShardMapManager, see [Shard map management](sql-database-elastic-scale-shard-map-management.md). For an overview of the elastic database tools, see [Elastic Database features overview](sql-database-elastic-scale-introduction.md).

## Preparation of the shard map manager database
You can use a new or existing database as the shard map manager. 

## Step 1: create a shard map manager
Note that a database acting as shard map manager shouldn’t be the same database as a shard. 

	# Create a shard map manager. 
	New-ShardMapManager -UserName '<user_name>' 
	-Password '<password>' 
	-SqlServerName '<server_name>' 
	-SqlDatabaseName '<smm_db_name>' 
	#<server_name> and <smm_db_name> are the server name and database name 
	# for the new or existing database that should be used for storing 
	# tenant-database mapping information.

### To retrieve the shard map manager

After creation, you can retrieve the shard map manager with this cmdlet. This step is needed every time you need to use the ShardMapManager object.

	# Try to get a reference to the Shard Map Manager  
	$ShardMapManager = Get-ShardMapManager -UserName '<user_name>' 
	-Password '<password>' 
	-SqlServerName '<server_name>' 
	-SqlDatabaseName '<smm_db_name>' 

  
## Step 2: create a shard map

The choice is to create one of the following models: 

1. Single tenant per database 
2. Multiple tenants per database (two types):
	3. Range mapping
	4. List mapping
 

If you are using a single-tenant database model, use the list mapping. The single-tenant model assigns one database per tenant. This is an effective model for SaaS developers as it simplifies management.

![List mapping][1]

In contrast, the multi-tenant database model assigns several tenants to a single database (and you can distribute groups of tenants across multiple databases). This is a viable model when the amount of data per tenant is expected to be small. In this model, we assign a range of tenants to a database using *range mapping*. 
 

![Range mapping][2]

You can also implement a multi-tenant database model using a list mapping to assign multiple tenants to a single database. For example, DB1 is used to store information about tenant id 1 and 5, and DB2 stores data for tenant 7 and tenant 10. 

![Muliple tenants on single DB][3] 


## Step 2, option 1: create a shard map for a list mapping
Create a shard map using the ShardMapManager object. 

	# $ShardMapManager is the shard map manager object. 
	$ShardMap = New-ListShardMap -KeyType $([int]) 
	-ListShardMapName 'ListShardMap' 
	-ShardMapManager $ShardMapManager 
 
 
## Step 2, option 2: create a shard map for a range mapping

Note that to utilize this mapping pattern, tenant id values needs to be continuous ranges, and it is acceptable to have gap in the ranges by simply skipping the range when creating the databases.

	# $ShardMapManager is the shard map manager object 
	# 'RangeShardMap' is the unique identifier for the range shard map.  
	$ShardMap = New-RangeShardMap 
	-KeyType $([int]) 
	-RangeShardMapName 'RangeShardMap' 
	-ShardMapManager $ShardMapManager 

## Step 2, option 3: List mappings on a single database
Setting up this pattern also requires creation of a list map as shown in step 2, option 1.

## Step 3: Prepare individual shards

Add each shard (database) to the shard map manager. This prepares the individual databases for storing mapping information. Execute this method on each shard.
	 
	Add-Shard 
	-ShardMap $ShardMap 
	-SqlServerName '<shard_server_name>' 
	-SqlDatabaseName '<shard_database_name>'
	# The $ShardMap is the shard map created in step 2.
 

## Step 4: add mappings

The addition of mappings depends on the kind of shard map you created. If you created a list map, you add list mappings. If you created a range map, you add range mappings.

### Step 4 option 1: map the data for a list mapping

Map the data by adding a list mapping for each tenant.  

	# Create the mappings and associate it with the new shards 
	Add-ListMapping 
	-KeyType $([int]) 
	-ListPoint '<tenant_id>' 
	-ListShardMap $ShardMap 
	-SqlServerName '<shard_server_name>' 
	-SqlDatabaseName '<shard_database_name>' 

### Step 4 option 2: map the data for a range mapping

Add the range mappings for all the tenant id range – database associations:

	# Create the mappings and associate it with the new shards 
	Add-RangeMapping 
	-KeyType $([int]) 
	-RangeHigh '5' 
	-RangeLow '1' 
	-RangeShardMap $ShardMap 
	-SqlServerName '<shard_server_name>' 
	-SqlDatabaseName '<shard_database_name>' 


### Step 4 option 3: map the data for multiple tenants on a single database

For each tenant, run the Add-ListMapping (option 1, above). 


## Checking the mappings

Information about the existing shards and the mappings associated with them can be queried using following commands:  

	# List the shards and mappings 
	Get-Shards -ShardMap $ShardMap 
	Get-Mappings -ShardMap $ShardMap 

## Summary

Once you have completed the setup, you can begin to use the Elastic Database client library. You can also use [data dependent routing](sql-database-elastic-scale-data-dependent-routing.md) and [multi-shard query](sql-database-elastic-scale-multishard-querying.md).

## Next steps


Get the PowerShell scripts from [Azure SQL DB-Elastic Database tools sripts](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Azure-SQL-DB-Elastic-731883db).

The tools are also on GitHub: [Azure/elastic-db-tools](https://github.com/Azure/elastic-db-tools).

Use the split-merge tool to move data to or from a multi-tenant model to a single tenant model. See [Split merge tool](sql-database-elastic-scale-get-started.md).
