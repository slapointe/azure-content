# Active Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database

## Overview
The Active Geo-Replication feature implements a mechanism to provide database redundancy within the same Microsoft Azure region or in different regions (geo-redundancy). Active Geo-Replication asynchronously replicates committed transactions from a database to up to four copies of the database on different servers. When Active Geo-Replication is configured a secondary database is created on the specified server. The original database becomes the primary database. The primary database asynchronously replicates committed transactions to each of the secondary databases. While at any given point, the secondary database might be slightly behind the primary database, the secondary data is guaranteed to always be transactionally consistent with changes committed to the primary database.

One of the primary benefits of Active Geo-Replication is that it provides a database-level disaster recovery solution with very low recovery time. When you place the secondary database on a server in a different region you add maximum resilience to your application. The cross-region redundancy enables applications to recover from a permanent loss of an entire datacenter or parts of a datacenter caused by natural disasters, catastrophic human errors, or malicious acts. The following figure shows an example of Active Geo-Replication configured on a Premium database with a primary in the West US region and secondary in the East US region.

Another key benefit is that the secondary databases are readable and can be used to offload read-only workloads such as reporting jobs. If you only intend to use the secondary database for load-balancing you can create it in the same region as the primary. This however will not increase the application's resilience to catastrophic failures.  

Other scenarios where Active Geo-Replication can be used include:

- **Database migration**: You can use Active Geo-Replication to migrate a database from one server to another online with minimum downtime.
- **Application upgrades**: You can create an extra secondary as a fail back copy during application upgrades.

To achieve real business continuity, adding database redundancy between datacenters is only part of the solution. Recovering an application (service) end-to-end after a catastrophic failure requires recovery of all components that constitute the service and any dependent services. Examples of these components include the client software (for example, a browser with a custom JavaScript), web front ends, storage, and DNS. It is critical that all components are resilient to the same failures and become available within the recovery time objective (RTO) of your application. Therefore, you need to identify all dependent services and understand the guarantees and capabilities they provide. Then, you must take adequate steps to ensure that your service functions during the failover of the services on which it depends. For more information about designing solutions for disaster recovery, see [Designing Cloud Solutions for Disaster Recovery Using Active Geo-Replication](sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery.md).

## Active Geo-Replication capabilities
The Active Geo-Replication feature provides the following essential capabilities:

- **Automatic Asynchronous Replication**: You can only create a secondary database by adding to an existing database. The seconadry can only be created in a different Azure SQL Database server. Once created the secondary database is populated with the data copied from the primary database. This process is known as seeding. After secondary database has been created and seeded, updates to the primary database are asynchronously replicated to the secondary database automatically. This means that transactions are committed on the primary database before they are replicated to the secondary database. SQL Database guarantees that once seeding is completed the secondary database remains transactionally consistent at all times. For more information about creating the secondary database see [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using Transact-SQL](sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql.md) and [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using PowerShell](sql-database-geo-replication-powershell.md).  Refer to [Configure geo-replication for Azure SQL Database with the Azure portal](sql-database-geo-replication-portal.md) for details of creating secondary database using Azure Portal.

- **Multiple secondary databases**: Two or more secondary databases increase redundancy and level of protection for the primary database and application. If multiple secondary databases exist, the application will remain protected even if one of the secondary databases fails. If there is only one secondary database, and it fails, the application is exposed to higher risk until a new secondary database is created.

- **Readable secondary databases**: An application can access a secondary database for read-only operations using the same or different security principals used for accessing the primary database. The secondary databases operate in snapshot isolation mode to ensure replication of the updates of the primary (log replay) is not delayed by queries executed on the secondary.

>[AZURE.NOTE] The log replay will be delayed on the secondary if there are schema updates that it is receiving from the Primary as it requires a schema lock on the secondary database.

- **Active geo-replication of elastic pool databases**: Active geo-replication can be configured for any database in a Premium elastic database pool. The secondary database can be in another Premium elastic database pool. For regular databases, the secondary can be an elastic database pool and vice versa as long as the service tiers are the same. For details of how to configure geo-replication for elastic pool databases see [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using Transact-SQL](sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql.md) and [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using PowerShell](sql-database-geo-replication-powershell.md).  

- **Configurable performance level of the secondary database**: A secondary database can be created with lower performance level than the primary. Both primary and secondary databases are required to have the same service tier. This option is not recommended for applications with high database write activity as it may result in increased replication lag and therefore, has high risk of substantial data loss after failover. In addition, after failover the application’s performance will be impacted until the new primary is upgraded to a higher performance level. The log IO percentage chart on Azure Portal provides a good way to estimate the minimal performance level of the secondary that will be required to sustain the replication load. For example, if your Primary database is P6 (1000 DTU) and its log IO percent is 50% the secondary needs to be at least P4 (500 DTU). You can also retrieve the log IO data using [sys.resource_stats](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn269979.aspx) or [sys.dm_db_resource_stats]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn800981.aspx) database views.  For more information on the SQL Database performance levels, see [SQL Database options and performance](sql-database-service-tiers.md). For details of how to configure performance level of the secondary database examples see [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using Transact-SQL](sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql.md) and [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using PowerShell](sql-database-geo-replication-powershell.md).  

- **User-controlled failover and failback**: A secondary database can be switched to the primary role at any time via an explicit action by the application or the user. During a real outage the “unplanned” option should be used, which will immediately promote a secondary to primary. When the failed primary recovers and is available again, the system will automatically mark it as a secondary and bring it up-to-date with the new primary. Due to the asynchronous nature of replication a small amount of data can be lost during unplanned failovers if a primary fails before it replicates the most recent changes to the secondary. When a primary with multiple secondaries fails over the system will automatically reconfigure the replication relationships and link the remaining secondaries to the newly promoted primary without requiring any user intervention. After the outage that caused the failover is mitigated it may be desirable to return the application to the primary region. To do that the failover command should be invoked with the “planned” option. For more information about how to activate failover using T-SQL see [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using Transact-SQL](sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql.md). For more information how to activate failover using PowerShell, see [Geo-Replication for Azure SQL Database using PowerShell](sql-database-geo-replication-powershell.md).  

- **Keeping credentials and firewall rules in sync**: We recommend the use of [database firewall rules](sql-database-firewall-configure.md) for geo-replicated databases so that these rules can be replicated with the database to ensure all secondary databases have the same firewall configuration as the primary. This eliminates the need for customers to manually configure and maintain firewall rules on servers hosting both the primary and secondary databases. Similarly, using [contained database users](sql-database-manage-logins.md) for data access ensures both primary and secondary databases always have the same user credentials so that in case of failovers there will be no disruptions due to mismatch in logins and passwords. With the addition of [Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/active-directory-whatis.md) customers can manage user access to both primary and secondary databases and eliminating the need for managing credentials in databases all together.

- **Azure Resource Manager API and role-based security**: Active geo-replication includes a set of [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163571.aspx) for management, including [ARM-based PowerShell cmdlets](sql-database-geo-replication-powershell.md). These APIs require the use of resource groups and support role based security (RBAC). For more information on how to implement access roles see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md).

>[AZURE.NOTE] The existing [Azure SQL Service Management (classic) REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn505719.aspx) and [Azure SQL Database (classic) cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn546723.aspx) are supported for backward compatibility. However, many new features of active geo-replication are only supported in ARM based [Azure SQL REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163571.aspx) and the ARM based [Azure SQL Database PowerShell cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt574084.aspx).

## Preventing the loss of critical data
Due to the high latency of wide area networks, continuous copy uses an asynchronous replication mechanism. This makes some data loss unavoidable if a failure occurs. However, some applications may require no data loss. To protect these critical updates, an application developer can call the [sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn467644.aspx) system procedure immediately after committing the transaction. Calling **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** blocks the calling thread until the last committed transaction has been replicated to the secondary database. The procedure will wait until all queued transactions have been acknowledged by the secondary database. **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** is scoped to a specific continuous copy link. Any user with the connection rights to the primary database can call this procedure.

>[AZURE.NOTE] The delay caused by a **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** procedure call might be significant. The delay depends on the size of the transaction log length at the moment and will not return until the entire log is replicated. Avoid calling this procedure unless absolutely necessary.
