# Troubleshoot common connection issues to Azure SQL Database
[AZURE.INCLUDE [support-disclaimer](../../includes/support-disclaimer.md)]

Connection issues to Azure SQL Database can be broadly classified as any of the following:

- Transient errors (short-lived or intermittent)
- Persistent or non-transient errors (errors that regularly recur)

If your application is experiencing transient errors, review the following topics for tips about how to troubleshoot and reduce the frequency of these errors:

- [Troubleshooting Database &lt;x&gt; on Server &lt;y&gt; is unavailable (Error: 40613)](sql-database-troubleshoot-connection.md)
- [Troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and transient errors for SQL Database](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md)

If the application persistently fails to connect to SQL Azure Database, it usually indicates an issue with one of the following:

- Firewall configuration. The Azure SQL database or client-side firewall is blocking connections to Azure SQL Database.
- Network reconfiguration on the client side: for example, a new IP address or a proxy server.
- User error: for example, mistyped connection parameters, such as the server name in the connection string.

## Steps to resolve persistent connectivity issues
1.	Set up [firewall rules](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md) to allow the client IP address.
2.	On all firewalls between the client and the Internet, make sure that port 1433 is open for outbound connections. Review [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc646023.aspx) for additional pointers.
3.	Verify your connection string and other connection settings. See the Connection String section in the [connectivity issues topic](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md#connections-to-azure-sql-database).
4.	Check service health in the dashboard. If you think thereâ€™s a regional outage, see [Recover from an outage](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) for steps to recover to a new region.
5.	If connectivity problems persist, file an Azure support request by selecting **Get Support** on the [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options) site.
