# What do I do if my Azure subscription becomes disabled?

Your Azure subscription can become disabled for the following reasons:

### You have reached the spending limit

For more information about spending limits see [Azure Spending Limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/). This article explains that when your usage exhausts the monthly amounts included in your offer, we will disable your service for the remainder of that billing month. It goes on to describe how you can remove your Spending Limit.

### Payment of an invoice is past due

To resolve this, see the article [Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?](billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance.md)

### The Azure subscription is cancelled

To reactivate a subscription, you must create a support ticket: sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Help + support**>**New support request**.

If you cannot access the portal, submit the support request from the Azure Support web site or from the Azure Accounts Center:

 * To submit a support ticket from the [Azure Support web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/), click **Get support**.
 * To submit a support ticket from the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions), select a subscription, and then click **Contact Microsoft Support**.
