# Managing table distribution skew
When table data is distributed using the hash distribution method there is a chance that the distribution of the data will be "skewed".

If you identify that some distributions have disproportionately more data than others then the table is said to be skewed. Depending on the degree of the skew you may want to address it. Excessive data skew will have an impact on query performance as the distributed compute resources will not be consumed evenly.

This article is designed to help you identify data skew in your hash distributed tables.

## Finding distribution skew

A query like the view below can help you identify skewed tables.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.vDistributionSkew
AS
WITH base
AS
(
select 
	SUBSTRING(@@version,34,4)															AS  [build_number]
,	GETDATE()																			AS  [execution_time]
,	DB_NAME()																			AS  [database_name]
,	s.name																				AS  [schema_name]
,	t.name																				AS  [table_name]
,	QUOTENAME(s.name)+'.'+QUOTENAME(t.name)												AS  [two_part_name]
,	nt.[name]																			AS  [node_table_name]
,	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY nt.[name] ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))					AS  [node_table_name_seq]
,	tp.[distribution_policy_desc]														AS  [distribution_policy_name]
,	nt.[distribution_id]																AS  [distribution_id]
,	nt.[pdw_node_id]																	AS  [pdw_node_id]
,	pn.[type]																			AS	[pdw_node_type]
,	pn.[name]																			AS	[pdw_node_name]
,	nps.[partition_number]																AS	[partition_nmbr]
,	nps.[reserved_page_count]															AS	[reserved_space_page_count]
,	nps.[reserved_page_count] - nps.[used_page_count]									AS	[unused_space_page_count]
,	nps.[in_row_data_page_count] 
	+ nps.[row_overflow_used_page_count] + nps.[lob_used_page_count]					AS  [data_space_page_count]
,	nps.[reserved_page_count] 
	- (nps.[reserved_page_count] - nps.[used_page_count]) 
	- ([in_row_data_page_count]+[row_overflow_used_page_count]+[lob_used_page_count])	AS  [index_space_page_count]
,	nps.[row_count]																		AS  [row_count]
from sys.schemas s
join sys.tables t								ON	s.[schema_id]			= t.[schema_id]
join sys.pdw_table_distribution_properties	tp	ON	t.[object_id]			= tp.[object_id]
join sys.pdw_table_mappings tm					ON	t.[object_id]			= tm.[object_id]
join sys.pdw_nodes_tables nt					ON	tm.[physical_name]		= nt.[name]
join sys.dm_pdw_nodes pn 						ON  nt.[pdw_node_id]		= pn.[pdw_node_id]
join sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats nps	ON	nt.[object_id]			= nps.[object_id]
												AND nt.[pdw_node_id]		= nps.[pdw_node_id]
												AND nt.[distribution_id]	= nps.[distribution_id]

,		([index_space_page_count]	 * 8.0)/1073741824	AS [index_space_TB]
FROM	base
)
SELECT	* 
FROM	size
;
```

Once the view has been created we can simply query it to validate the skew in our tables using a query like the one below.

```sql
SELECT	[two_part_name]
,		[distribution_id]
,		[row_count]
,		[reserved_space_GB]
,		[unused_space_GB]
,		[data_space_GB]
,		[index_space_GB]
FROM	[dbo].[vDistributionSkew]
WHERE	[table_name] = 'FactInternetSales'
ORDER BY [row_count] DESC
```

>[AZURE.NOTE] ROUND_ROBIN distributed tables should not be skewed. Data is distributed evenly across the nodes by design.

## Resolving data skew
There are times when the skew is worth retaining. Typically this is when the table is being joined on a shared distribution key.

However, to resolve data skew a different column would typically be chosen. Using ROUND_ROBIN instead of HASH is also an option.

Refer to the recommendations section in the [Hash distribution][] article for further guidance on selecting a different column.
