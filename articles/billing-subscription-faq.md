## Billing

### What payment options do I have in purchasing Azure?

You can purchase Azure using a credit or debit card or choose to be invoiced.

**NOTE:**

- Once you opt for the invoice option, you can't move to the credit card option. To sign up for invoicing, see [Azure Invoicing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).
- Please note that we do not accept prepaid and virtual credit cards.
- You are solely responsible for any credit card interest or other credit card charges that may result.

### How can I request the invoice method of payment?

Follow the steps in [Azure Invoicing](https://azure.microsoft.com//pricing/invoicing/) to submit a request to pay by invoice. Once your request has been approved, you will be provided instructions on how to set up your subscription for the invoice payment method.

### How do I check the status of a payment made by credit card?

You must submit a support ticket to request assistance. To create a support ticket to check the status of a payment made by credit card see [How to Create a Support Ticket for Azure Billing and Subscription Issues](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md).

### How do I get a copy of my invoice?

As the Azure Account Administrator, you can view the current bill at the Azure Account Center and download statements for the previous six billing periods as well. For more detail, see [How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md).

### How do I remove a credit card that I no longer use as an Azure payment method?

You must submit a support ticket to request assistance. To create a support ticket to remove a credit card, see the article [How to Create a Support Ticket for Azure Billing and Subscription Issues](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md).

### How can I update or change my credit card information?

For instructions about how to use a different credit card as a payment method, or how to add a new credit card see [How to change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md).

### How do we know in advance about service downtime for planned maintenance?

Our Service Level Agreement for availability applies to customer applications which use a minimum of two role instances.  There is no SLA for single instances. Please refer to your [SLA page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/) for complete details.

**Planned maintenance (Classic Portal)**: For both single- and multi-instance configurations, Azure sends email communications in advance to alert you of upcoming planned maintenance (one week in advance for single-instance and 48 hours in advance for multi-instance). The email will be sent to the Account Administrator, Service Administrator and Co-administrator email accounts provided in the subscription.

**NOTE:** For more information specific to Virtual Machines see the article [Planned maintenance for Azure virtual machines](virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-planned-maintenance.md).

**Unplanned maintenance:** In the event of an unplanned service disruption on the Azure Platform, status updates will be made on our [service dashboard](http://status.azure.com/)  and customers will also receive notice in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

### What is the Azure SLA agreement for uptime and connectivity?

Azure has separate SLA’s for all services that are generally available and not in preview. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes Microsoft’s commitments for uptime and connectivity. Please refer to your [SLA page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/) for the latest details.

### What are the Azure SLA Credits?

Azure SLA Credits are calculated on a per subscription basis as a percentage of the bill for that service in the billing month the SLA was missed. The service credits are applied to the subsequent month’s bill. Generally, we provide 10% credit if we fall below the first threshold (99.95% or 99.9%, depending on the service) and 25% if we fall beneath the subsequent threshold (99%). Please refer to your [SLA page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/) for complete details.

### How will Azure Service Level Agreements work with current on premises Microsoft licensing agreements?

Azure Service Level Agreements are independent of our on-premises Microsoft licensing agreements. Our SLAs for Azure provide you a monthly uptime guarantee for those services you consume in the cloud, with SLA credits against what we have billed you in the event we fail to meet the guarantee.

## Subscriptions

### How do I purchase Azure Support?
Azure Support plans may be purchased either online or through an Enterprise Agreement. The Developer, Standard, or Professional Direct Support plans are available online through the [Azure Support Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) page. You must be the Microsoft Azure account owner to purchase a support plan.

If you purchase Microsoft Azure through an Enterprise Agreement (EA), you can add either a Standard or Professional Direct support plan to your Enterprise Agreement, by contacting your Large Account Reseller (LAR). Developer Support is not available through an Enterprise Agreement.

### Does the monthly rate cover a single Azure plan or the entire account?

The flat monthly cost for Azure Support covers one account, regardless of how many subscriptions or users you have on the account.

All subscriptions under an account will share the same support plan, and all users with admin/owner access to any of the subscriptions under the account with a Support Plan will also be entitled to support for those specific account’s subscriptions they have access to.

A Microsoft Azure account can be accessed from the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index). From there you can see the list of subscriptions that belong to the account and will be entitled for support.

### How do I upgrade to a higher tier Azure Support plan?

You can upgrade to a higher-tier plan by [submitting a support request](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md) and choosing a “Subscription Management”. Microsoft will waive the remaining payments on your original Azure Support plan and charge you at the higher tier for the remaining months of your initial commitment.

### When will I be billed for Azure Support?

When you purchase an Azure Support plan online, you will be charged immediately for the first month. You will be charged the monthly amount on the first day of each subsequent billing cycle. Enterprise Agreement (EA) purchases will follow the agreement billing cycle.

### What happens at the end of the term?

At the end of your 6-month term, your plans will automatically renew to the same Azure Support plan for another 6 months, using the same payment method. As an account owner, you can elect to turn off the auto-renew functionality through the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

If you do not wish to auto renew, please log into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index), select the support plan in question, click on the "Change renewal details," and unselect the default option to auto renew.

### How do I cancel my Azure Support plan?

An account owner can cancel an Azure Support plan by logging into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index), selecting “ACCOUNT CENTER”, and selecting “subscriptions”. If you have a subscription, your list of subscriptions will be displayed. Select the subscription you wish to cancel. The details of the subscription will then be displayed with a list of options on the right side of the screen. Select “Cancel” and proceed. If you do not have a subscription, then the message “You do not have any subscriptions.” will be displayed.

Note that an Azure Support plan has a 6-month term and Microsoft requires continued monetary commitment for the duration of the term. Cancellation before the term expires does not forgive the remaining commitment or provide refunds any pre-paid amount.
For details see [How to cancel your Azure subscription](billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription.md).

### How do I migrate data and services for my Azure subscription to a new subscription?

Please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) for more information. To create a support ticket to migrate data and services for an Azure subscription to a new subscription see the article [How to Create a Support Ticket for Azure Billing and Subscription Issues](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md).

### How do I manage Administrator accounts in the new Azure portal?

Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can segregate duties within your DevOps team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. For more information, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](.\active-directory\Azure Role-Based Access Control.md).

### How do I transfer ownership of my subscriptions?

You can now do this easily in the Microsoft Azure Account Center- for Pay-As-You-Go, MSDN, Action Pack, or BizSpark subscriptions. We’ve added the ability to transfer your subscription to another user. In other words, you can now change the account admin on any Pay-As-You-Go, MSDN, Action Pack, or BizSpark subscription that you own. Note that the recipient’s user account must be in the same country and that you cannot transfer subscriptions that are associated with a marketplace purchase.
For details, see the article [How to transfer an Azure subscription](billing-subscription-transfer.md).

### Can I transfer server licenses to Azure and run them on Virtual Machines?

Yes, through license mobility if you have SA you can "bring-your-own-license" for all Virtual Machines supported server products except for Windows Server.

### Where can I find the Benefits and Pricing information for Azure Services?

For information on the benefits of Azure services, see [Microsoft Azure Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/). For pricing information, see the [Azure pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### How do I change my pricing plan?

You can switch your Pay-As-You-Go subscription to the [12-Month Prepay Offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0026p/). With this offer, you prepay for Azure services for a 12-month term and receive a 5% discount on Azure services. In the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions), go to your subscription and click on Switch Offer. This is currently the only offer that can be switched via the Account Center. Alternatively, you can contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) to switch to a different offer.

### Can notifications be sent to a different email address other than the Account Owner email address associated with my account?

Yes. If you would like to specify a different email address to receive notifications, please follow these directions:

1.	Go to the [Profile tab](https://account.windowsazure.com/Profile) in the Azure Accounts Portal.
2.	Click **Edit Details** to update your email address to receive notifications.

### How can I edit my payment information for my Azure Subscription/s?

To view and edit the Azure account information, you must sign in to the Azure Account Center as the account administrator. Below are instructions in managing the payment method for Azure subscription/s.**

1.	Go to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).
2.	On the subscriptions page, click the subscription for which you want to update the payment method.

For more information, see the article [How to change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md).

**NOTE**: Currently, the Change Payment Method tool does not allow you to remove an existing credit card as a payment method. For information about how to remove a credit card, see the FAQ "How do I remove a credit card that I no longer use as an Azure payment method?" in this article.

### Why I cannot edit or add details to my subscription?

To view and edit the Azure account information, you must sign in to the Azure Account Center as the account administrator.  If you are the AA and still cannot edit the subscription, please submit a support ticket to request assistance.

### Who can purchase Azure services?

Azure is intended for use by businesses to build cloud scale applications and services. However, anyone may purchase Azure services.

### Can I try Azure for free, without any risk of being charged?

Yes. With our [Spending Limit feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), customers who sign up for a Free Trial, MSDN, MPN or BizSpark offer can utilize Azure without any fear of getting charged as long as they keep the Spending Limit feature turned on.
For information on signing up for Azure, see the article [How to sign up for, purchase, upgrade or activate an Azure subscription](billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription.md).

### Can I turn the Spending Limit back on if I turn off it?

For those on our member benefit offers (e.g., MSDN), you do have the ability to have the Spending Limit feature re-enabled at the beginning of your next billing cycle. The Spending Limit cannot be re-enabled for the current billing period once turned off.
For more information, see [Change the Azure Spending Limit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn465781.aspx).

### Can I adjust the amount of the Spending Limit?

For the initial release of this feature, the Spending Limit is set at $0 and cannot be adjusted. It is designed to enable customers on our Free Trial, MSDN, MPN or BizSpark offers to utilize Azure with complete assurance of not being billed.
For more information, see Azure Spending Limit(https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/).
