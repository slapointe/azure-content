# Get insights from Azure Security Center data with Power BI
The [Power BI Dashboard](http://aka.ms/azure-security-center-power-bi) for Azure Security Center enables you to visualize, analyze, and filter recommendations and security alerts from anywhere, including your mobile device. Use the Power BI dashboard to reveal trends and attack patterns - view security alerts by resource or source IP address and unaddressed security risks by resource or age. You can also mash up Security Center recommendations and security alerts with other data in interesting ways, for example with [Azure Audit Logs](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/monitor-azure-audit-logs-with-power-bi/) and [Azure SQL Database Auditing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/monitor-your-azure-sql-database-auditing-activity-with-power-bi/), which both offer Power BI Dashboards, or you can export this data to Excel for easy reporting on the security state of your cloud resources.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The information in this document applies to the preview release of Azure Security Center.

## Exploring your Azure Security Center data with Power BI services
Connect to the [Azure Security Center content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getdata/services/azure-security-center) in Power BI and follow the steps below:

1.Click **Connect** in the Azure Security Center tile to continue.

3.In the **Authentication method** drop down list, select **oAuth2** and click **Sign In**.

![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig3.png)

4.You will be redirected to an authentication page where you should type the credentials that you are using to connect to Azure Security Center. After the authentication process is done, Power BI will start importing data to build your reports. During this time you may see the following message on the right corner of your browser:

![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig4.png)

5.Once the process is finished, your Azure Security Center Power BI dashboard will load with the reports as shown below:

![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig5.png)

At a glance you can see the number of security alerts and recommendations as well as the number of VMs, Azure SQL databases and network resources being monitored by Azure Security Center. 

A link to Azure Security Center redirects you to the Azure portal. The charts make it easy to visualize information about security recommendations and alerts, including: 

- Resource Security Health
- Pending Recommendations Overall
- VM Recommendations
- Alerts over Time
- Attacked Resources
- Attacked IPs

Behind each chart there are additional insights. Select a tile to see more information, for example the Resource Security Health tile shows you additional details about pending recommendations by resources as shown below:

![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig6.png)

If you click on any line of this graph, the others will be gray out and you focus only on the one you selected. To return to the dashboard, click **Azure Security Center** under the **Dashboards** option on the left pane of this page. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you’d like to customize your reports, by adding additional fields or changing existing visuals, you can edit the report. Read [Interact with a report in Editing View in Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view/) for more information.

The **Alerts over Time**, **Attacked Resources** and **Attacker IPs** tiles will have the similar output when you click on each one of it. This happens because the report aggregates information regarding all those three variables and calls it **Resources under Attack** as shown below:

![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig7.png)

At this point you can also save a copy of this report, print it or publish it on the web by using the options available in the **File** menu.
