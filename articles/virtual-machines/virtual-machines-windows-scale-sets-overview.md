# Virtual Machine Scale Sets Overview



[AZURE.INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-scale-sets-overview](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-scale-sets-overview.md)]

Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure Compute resource you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. With all VMs configured the same, VM scale sets are designed to support true autoscale – no pre-provisioning of VMs are required – and as such make it easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.
