# How to tag a Windows virtual machine in Azure


This article describes different ways to tag a Windows virtual machine in Azure through the Azure Resource Manager. Tags are user-defined key/value pairs which can be placed directly on a resource or a resource group. Azure currently supports up to 15 tags per resource and resource group. Tags may be placed on a resource at the time of creation or added to an existing resource. Please note that tags are supported for resources created via the Azure Resource Manager only. If you want to tag a Linux virtual machine, see [How to tag a Linux virtual machine in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-tag.md).

## Tagging with PowerShell

To create, add, and delete tags through PowerShell, you first need to set up your [PowerShell environment with Azure Resource Manager][]. Once you have completed the setup, you can place tags on Compute, Network, and Storage resources at creation or after the resource is created via PowerShell. This article will concentrate on viewing/editing tags placed on Virtual Machines.

First, navigate to a Virtual Machine through the `Get-AzureVM` cmdlet.

        PS C:\> Get-AzureVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyWindowsVM"

If your Virtual Machine already contains tags, you will then see all the tags on your resource:

        Tags : {
                "Application": "MyApp1",
                "Created By": "MyName",
                "Department": "MyDepartment",
                "Environment": "Production"
               }

If you would like to add tags through PowerShell, you can use the `Set-AzureResource` command. Note when updating tags through PowerShell, tags are updated as a whole. So if you are adding one tag to a resource that already has tags, you will need to include all the tags that you want to be placed on the resource. Below is an example of how to add additional tags to a resource through PowerShell Cmdlets.

This first cmdlet sets all of the tags placed on *MyWindowsVM* to the *tags* variable, using the `Get-AzureResource` and `Tags` function. Note that the parameter `ApiVersion` is optional; if not specified, the latest API version of the resource provider is used. 

        PS C:\> $tags = (Get-AzureResource -Name MyWindowsVM -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -ResourceType "Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines" -ApiVersion 2015-05-01-preview).Tags

The second command displays the tags for the given variable.

        PS C:\> $tags

        Name		Value
        ----                           -----
        Value		MyDepartment
        Name		Department
        Value		MyApp1
        Name		Application
        Value		MyName
        Name		Created By
        Value		Production
        Name		Environment

The third command adds an additional tag to the *tags* variable. Note the use of the **+=** to append the new Key/Value pair to the *tags* list.

        PS C:\> $tags +=@{Name="Location";Value="MyLocation"}

The fourth command sets all of the tags defined in the *tags* variable to the given resource. In this case, it is MyWindowsVM.

        PS C:\> Set-AzureResource -Name MyWindowsVM -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -ResourceType "Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachines" -ApiVersion 2015-05-01-preview -Tag $tags

The fifth command displays all of the tags on the resource. As you can see, *Location* is now defined as a tag with *MyLocation* as the value.

        PS C:\> (Get-AzureResource -ResourceName "MyWindowsVM" -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -ResourceType "Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachines" -ApiVersion 2015-05-01-preview).Tags

        Name		Value
        ----                           -----
        Value		MyDepartment
        Name		Department
        Value		MyApp1
        Name		Application
        Value		MyName
        Name		Created By
        Value		Production
        Name		Environment
        Value		MyLocation
        Name		Location
