## Starting the Privileged Identity Management extension

1. Create a directory in Azure Active Directory.

3. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator of that directory.
4. Click on your username in the upper right hand corner of the Azure portal.
5. Select the directory you just created.
6. Click the **New** icon in the left navigation.
7. Select **Security + Identity** from the Create menu.
